## Features Overview

We at F4 Services have done our due dilligence to properly implement as many features as possible from the API of Fooocus'
source code into Discord itself. Here is a general list of features we offer with Fooocus
 - Text-to-Image Generation
 - Image-to-Image Generation
 - [GPT-2 Assisted Prompting](/docs/efficient-prompting)
 - Performance Models
 - [Image Manipulation](/docs/image-manipulation)
 - Image Inpainting
 - Image Outpainting
 - Seed Regeneration
 - Guidance Scaling

Note that this list is not complete, as Fooocus is still in development. Links to each of these features will be added as we continue to 
expand our documentation. Let us know what questions you have in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uHH4y2eEUQ)
