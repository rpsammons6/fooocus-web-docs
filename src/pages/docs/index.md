## Overview

**The Lazy Artist** is an image generating software and a rethinking of Stable Diffusion and Midjourneyâ€™s designs:

- Learned from Stable Diffusion and Flux and optimized for Discord

- Learned from Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.

The Lazy Artist has included and automated lots of inner optimizations and quality improvements. 
Users can forget all those difficult technical parameters, and just enjoy the creating images they love,
and *Retaking Their Imagination*

### Retaking your Imagination.


While there have been many Discord AI Image Generators in the past, and will be many after us, we have something
the others don't have - Modularity, cutting-edge technology, and - most importantly - a community of passionate and
creative people.

All of us are striving for one thing, and that's to maximize the potential of human creativity. There are countless people
who have incredible ideas they wish to share, but no means by which to share them. The Lazy Artist is the flagship way
which people can share exactly what they envision. This is directly reflected in the way we approach our product and our
interactions in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XpRMvAkyTv).

## What is Ink?

**Ink** is our way of making it easier for our consumers to track how their hard-earned money is being spent on our services.
Ink is the currency which runs The Lazy Artist. 1 Ink is equivalent to one image using our **[Lightning Model](/docs/lightning)**, one of our fastest
and most powerful models. As you request images from more complex and powerful models, the cost of the image will increase.
Below, you will find a list of the models we offer and their respective costs:

| **Model**       | Ink Cost |
|-------------|----------|
| **SCHNELL**     | 1        |
| **DEV**         | 10       |
| **PRO 1.1**     | 15       |
| **RECRAFT**     | 15       |
| **PRO**         | 20       |
| **RECRAFT SVG** | 30       |

Ink can be purchased through one of our subscriptions, which will allot you a certain number of ink per month. See
our **[Subscription Plans](/docs/features)** for more information.

However, if you are a free user, there are multiple ways you can earn ink. 10 ink is allotted to each free user each day to use,
which can be stacked and saved for later use to generate images using higher quality models. You can also earn an addition
10 ink by voting for us on **[Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/1282040578120355871)**. Further ink will be distributed as prizes in
**[Discord](https://discord.gg/XpRMvAkyTv) events**, the amount will be set on a event-by-event basis. You can also earn ink 
by referring friends to The Lazy Artist.
