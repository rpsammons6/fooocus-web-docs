## Overview

**The Lazy Artist** is an image generating software and a rethinking of Stable Diffusion and Midjourneyâ€™s designs:

- Learned from Stable Diffusion and Flux and optimized for Discord

- Learned from Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.

The Lazy Artist has included and automated lots of inner optimizations and quality improvements. 
Users can forget all those difficult technical parameters, and just enjoy the creating images they love,
and *Retaking Their Imagination*

### Retaking your Imagination.


While there have been many Discord AI Image Generators in the past, and will be many after us, we have something
the others don't have - Modularity, cutting-edge technology, and - most importantly - a community of passionate and
creative people.

All of us are striving for one thing, and that's to maximize the potential of human creativity. There are countless people
who have incredible ideas they wish to share, but no means by which to share them. The Lazy Artist is the flagship way
which people can share exactly what they envision. This is directly reflected in the way we approach our product and our
interactions in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XpRMvAkyTv).
