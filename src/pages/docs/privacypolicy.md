# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Email Privacy Policy outlines the measures and practices implemented by The Lazy Artist to protect the privacy and security of email communications. 
We are committed to safeguarding the personal information shared with us through email interactions.

## Collection of Information

### Types of Information Collected

When the user uses a "/" command, the user agrees to have their data securely stored in our database. This data is
exclusively Discord user information. Any further information received is given through the purchase of a subscription, and is
kept secure and encrypted at rest.

We may collect various types of information through email communications, including but not limited to:

- Email addresses
- Names
- Contact information
- Content of emails
- Discord User Information

### Purpose of Collection

The information collected through email communications is primarily used for the following purposes:

- Responding to inquiries and requests
- Providing requested services or information
- Sending updates, newsletters, or promotional materials
- Improving our products and services
- Ensuring the security of our systems and communications

## Use and Disclosure of Information

### Confidentiality

We treat all personal information received via email as confidential and do not disclose it to third parties unless required by law or with explicit consent from the individual.

### Internal Use

Personal information collected through email communications is used internally by authorized personnel only for the purposes stated in this policy.

### Third-Party Service Providers

We may engage third-party service providers to assist with email management and communication. These providers are contractually obligated to comply with our privacy and security standards.

### Legal Obligations

We may disclose personal information in response to lawful requests from government authorities, court orders, or legal processes.

## Security Measures

We employ various security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of email communications, including:

- Encryption technologies to secure data in transit
- Access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access
- Regular monitoring and auditing of email systems for suspicious activities
- Employee training programs on email security best practices

## Data Retention

We retain personal information collected via email for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. When no longer needed, we securely dispose of or anonymize the information.
All information is retained according to both the GDPR and CCPA, as well as the policies outlined by Discord. We are in compliance with Discord's policies and
our *Server Member Intent* is clearly outlined below.

All data is encrypted at rest with AES-256 encryption and is stored on secure servers. We do not store any data on local machines or devices.

### Server Member Intent

As submitted to Discord, we have outlined our intent for server members as follows:

We collect and use the profile data of those within the server to provide access to the bot both in 
Discord and in their online profile. This streamlines the user experience by allowing them to keep track 
of what images they have generated, how many tokens (ink) they have remaining, and allows us to 
verify the status of their subscription.

We store their Username, User ID, and their messages to the bot including images uploaded. We do not store any other information,
and this is for the purpose of providing the services outlined above and for preserving the safety and
liability of both the users and our company, ensuring that we can provide the best service possible.

## Your Rights

### Access and Correction

Individuals have the right to access and correct their personal information held by us. Requests for access or correction can be submitted to support@thelazyartistai.com.

### Requesting Deletion

Users can request deletion of their data at any time, regardless of their subscription status. To do so, they can contact us directly at support@thelazyartistai.com

## Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Email Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated policy on our website.
