## What is Ink?

**Ink** is our way of making it easier for our consumers to track how their hard-earned money is being spent on our services.
Ink is the currency which runs The Lazy Artist. 1 Ink is equivalent to one image using our **[Lightning Model](/docs/lightning)**, one of our fastest
and most powerful models. As you request images from more complex and powerful models, the cost of the image will increase.
Below, you will find a list of the models we offer and their respective costs:

| **Model**       | Ink Cost |
|-------------|----------|
| **SCHNELL**     | 1        |
| **DEV**         | 10       |
| **PRO 1.1**     | 15       |
| **RECRAFT**     | 15       |
| **PRO**         | 20       |
| **RECRAFT SVG** | 30       |

Ink can be purchased through one of our subscriptions, which will allot you a certain number of ink per month. See
our **[Subscription Plans](/docs/features)** for more information.

However, if you are a free user, there are multiple ways you can earn ink. 10 ink is allotted to each free user each day to use,
which can be stacked and saved for later use to generate images using higher quality models. You can also earn an addition
10 ink by voting for us on **[Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/1282040578120355871)**. Further ink will be distributed as prizes in
**[Discord](https://discord.gg/XpRMvAkyTv) events**, the amount will be set on a event-by-event basis. You can also earn ink
by referring friends to The Lazy Artist.

## How do I access my Ink balance?

You can access your ink balance by using /ink on the Discord bot. This command is available in any server, regardless of whether
you are a member of our server or not. The command will return your current balance of ink, as well as a link to purchase a subscription
if you don't already have one.

Alternatively, whenever you create an image with **The Lazy Artist** it will return the amount of ink used to generate the image, as well
as your remaining balance below the image. If it shows you are out of ink it will direct you to purchase a subscription at our **[Website]**(https://thelazyartistai.com).

If you would like to learn more about our subscriptions, please see our **[Documentation](/docs/features)**.

## Can I purchase Ink individually?

Unfortunately, we do not currently offer one-time purchases of ink. Ink can only be obtained through one of our subscription plans.
